◊h1{The Pyret Crew}

  ◊p{ Pyret started its life at the PLT group at Brown University in
      Providence, RI, USA, and the team is now spread across several
      institutions. Pyret’s design and development draw on the group’s
      experience in programming languages, education, web security,
      user interfaces, and more. }

  ◊p{ Ben Lerner and Joe Gibbs Politz are the main stewards of the
      language, and build and maintain the compiler and associated
      tools. Daniel Patterson and Dorai Sitaram have helped design and
      build its feel and core features. }

  ◊p{ The work of Danny Yoo and Emmanuel Schanzer on Whalesong and
      WeScheme have been indispensible both for inspiration and for
      re-use. }

  ◊p{ Pyret has numerous contributors. In no particular order, Jake
      Ellis, Frank Goodman, Sam Ainsworth, John Ericson, Sorawee
      Porncharoenwase, Alex St Laurent, Philip Blair, Matthew
      Kolosick, Jack Wrenn, Sarah Fischmann, Justin Pombrio, Cody
      Mello, Eric Caruso, Stevie Strickland, Liam Elberty, Kathi
      Fisler, Emmanuel Schanzer, Emma Youndtsmith, Jonah Kagan, Hilmar
      Hoffmann, and many users on the ◊code{pyret-discuss} mailing
      list and the Pyret Discord board have contributed ideas and
      code. }

  ◊p{ Numerous school teachers and college educators have used Pyret
      in their courses, and we are grateful to them and their
      students. }

  ◊p{ Early on, the students of Brown’s CSCI 0190, CSCI 1729, and CSCI
      1730, along with Swarthmore’s CS91, were press-ganged into
      service aboard the Pyret ship, but took to the high seas with
      grace. }

  ◊p{ Shriram Krishnamurthi provides the budget for t-shirts and
      stickers. }
