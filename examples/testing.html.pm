   Pyret provides an extensive set of features for
   ◊link/new-tab["https://pyret.org/docs/latest/testing.html"]{writing tests}.
   You
don't need a separate library or “build file” or write or run them.
It's part of the programming language, because we believe it is
imporant to write robust programs, and testing is a major component of
  that.
