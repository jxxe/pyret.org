   As students learn to work with invariants, it is helpful and
   instructive to express them directly in the source program. Pyret
   supports ◊em{refinments} to enable this. Currently, refinements in
   Pyret are checked dynamically, so that students don't have to go
   through the hurdles of convincing a proof-assistant that the
   program is compliant, and they can get concrete examples of
   failures.
