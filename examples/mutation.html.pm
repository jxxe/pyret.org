◊p{
   Pyret has both mutable variables and mutable structures. Pyret
   values are immutable by default (which reduces surprise and makes
   testing much easier), but mutation is available when needed:
   students just need to invoke it explicitly.
   }

◊p{
   Pyret support for mutable structures is especially smart.
   Mutable fields are displayed with black-and-yellow striping
   (what some students have labeled the “bumblebee”). This indicates
   that the value you are seeing may change. Furthermore, clicking on
   the bumblebee updates it to its current value!
