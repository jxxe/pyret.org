◊p{
Pyret provides a pleasant syntax for writing illustrative examples of
how functions should behave. These serve not only as documentation,
but are also useful for students to demonstrate their understanding of
a problem before they start programming. The
◊link/new-tab["https://blog.brownplt.org/2024/01/01/examplar.html"]{Examplar}
   project is built entirely around this feature.
  }

  ◊p{
Examples can be written
as part of the function definition or just after or
before. Stand-alone example blocks optionally take a descriptive
     string, which not only improve documentation but are also helpful
     for understanding failures.
